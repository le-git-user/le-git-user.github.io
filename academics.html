			<p id = "text"> As you may have expected, attending a <span style = "color: #FDB515"> prestigious university </span> comes with some hard classes, however, when confronted with such classes I came to the realization that I was <span style = "color: #FDB515">not prepared </span> for the amount of rigor that the school had demanded of me. High school had not prepared me in the slightest for the new classes, especially not STEM courses, which are <span style = "color: #FDB515"> notoriously known throughout campus. </span> Retrospectively I recommend studying courses before you take them and use as much time to attend office hours, if that's your schmick (... I understand the difficulty that may come with this event). Ultimately, however, I reccomend taking it slow. This may seem like lackluster advice, but under the pressure of such a <span style = "color: #FDB515"> competitive community, </span> you may find yourself overwhelmed.
			</p>
			<p id = "hidden-text"> Despite all of the <span style = "color: #FDB515"> hardships </span> that accompany the school, there are also many huge <span style = "color: #FDB515"> benefits, </span> that I feel sometimes often get overlooked, justifiably, since many students come to Berkeley for the purpose of pursuing higher education. However, Berkeley has a <span style = "color: #FDB515"> very vivid community </span> full of nice and friendly people willing to meet and hoping to have a good time. No matter what you're into, the campus is filled with such a diverse group of people that you are bound to find someone with similar interests as yours, <span style = "color: #FDB515"> so long as your willing. </span> However, if you like to be the more solitary type there are also many locations close to campus for one to explore alone. Although the school has been tough on me, the campus and experience makes the ongoing struggle <span style = "color: #FDB515"> ultimately fulfilling. </span>
