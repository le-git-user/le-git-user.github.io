			<p id = "text"> Hello! </br> &emsp; &emsp; I am currently a first-year student at the University of California Berkeley pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am a first generation student and come from Los Angeles Area. My motivation for creating this site came after hardships and confusion during my transition to Berkeley and although the site is dedicated to my experience as a Berkeley student, I hope that it will be useful to all students pursuing higher education. </br>
